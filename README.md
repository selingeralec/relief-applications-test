# relief-applications-test
coding test for relief-applications

This code runs on NodeJS, and runs on localHost 127.0.0.1:3000 when run. 
It parses a YouTube URL and stores the entered URL's watch history in localStorage. 
Users can also bookmark url's. The number of bookmarks is shown to users. Info is also stored in localStorage. 

Before this project I had no experience with the back end. I tried learning as much as I could in the week I had to develop everything. 
I didn't manage to develop the back end but I did learn a lot. I will continue to develop the app in my free time!
I also never encountered custom elements, and didn't manage to construct the classes to create custom classes. 
I expect to learn this in my free time as well. 

I think I learned a lot in this process and am grateful for the opportunity given to me by Relief Applications.
